## About Me 
Thanks for coming by my github!  I am a creative-thinking problem-solver, with a background in film production.  It was there that I learned the value of collaborative team-effort, and working hard under pressure.  I'm happy to be here and to contribute to the wonderful world of the internet! (Or interwebs, as us childrens of the net say.)  </br>
I firmly believe in the idea of spreading joy, love, (and silliness) whereever you go, and leaving things better than how you found them.
</br>
I want to contribute to making the world a bit more accessible, safe, and fun for everyone -- including online. </br>
