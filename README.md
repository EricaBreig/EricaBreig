## About Me 
Thanks for coming by my github!  I am a creative-thinking problem-solver, with a background in film production.  It was there that I learned the value of collaborative team-effort, and working hard under pressure.  I'm happy to be here and to contribute to the wonderful world of the internet! (Or interwebs, as we used to say.)

### When I am not coding, I am:
- cuddling my kitties (I have 3: two floofs, and a nakey!)
- studying history, and sewing historical costumes
- Performing historical dances
- Writing in my journal, or drafting a screenplay
- LARPing in Europe
- Watching the film Cyrano repeatedly and singing along
